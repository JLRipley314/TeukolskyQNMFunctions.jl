## Example files

The file `example\_calculation.ipynb` goes through an example on how to 
compute a quasinormal mode and eigenfunction.

The file `launch.jl' computes tables of some of the 
quasinormal modes and eigenfunctions that are used in the paper
[arXiv:2202.03837](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03837).
